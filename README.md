# lstm_based_attention_model_for_QA_system

It refers to the paper of LSTM-BASED DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR NON-FACTOID ANSWER SELECTION written by Ming Tan, etc. 

Based on Tensorflow in python, a model with lstm and attention mechanism are implemented. 

Considering my project relates to Chinese text, so I abandon the original insurance data and my data is of Chinese version.
